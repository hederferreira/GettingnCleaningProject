The two datasets generated by the run_analysis.r script are based on the original data that can be verified at https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.

## the first dataset the following steps were performed:

1.The test and training data were unified.
2.The columns were given the friendly names found in the original documentation.
3.Only the standard and average columns were extracted.
4.The subject_id variables and activities were aggregated to the dataset.

_The first DataSet is called final_df_

A second dataset was created base on the first dataset. 

It is grouped by activity and subject_id and averaged for each variable for each combination of activity and subject_id.

_The second dataset is called averages_df_

## Details on the measurement variables can be found in the original data documentation.

## The *activity* variable refers to the type of movement performed by the individual when the measurements were collected.

## The *subject_id* variable is an identifier of individuals ranging from 1 to 30.
